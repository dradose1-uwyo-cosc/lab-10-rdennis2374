# Files and Exceptions

# For this assignment, you will be writing a program to "crack" a password. You will need to open the file `hash` as this is the password you are trying to "crack."

# To begin, you will need to open the 'rockyou.txt' file:
# - This file contains a list of compromised passwords from the rockyou dump.
# - This is an abridged version, as the full version is quite large.
# - The file contains the plaintext version of the passwords. You will need to hash them to check against the password hash you are trying to crack.
#   - You can use the provided `get_hash()` function to generate the hashes.
#   - Be careful, as "hello" and "hello " would generate a different hash.

# You will need to include a try-except-catch block in your code.
# - The reading of files needs to occur in the try blocks.


# - Read in the value stored within `hash`.
#   - You must use a try and except block.


# Read in the passwords in `rockyou.txt`.
# - Again, you need a try-except-else block.
# Hash each individual password and compare it against the stored hash.
# - When you find the match, print the plaintext version of the password.
# - End your loop.

try:
    hash = Path('hash')
    hash_pass = hash.read_text().strip()
    try:
        path = Path('rockyou.txt')
        contents = path.read_text()
        lines = contents.splitlines()
        for item in lines:
            password = item
            code = get_hash(item)
            if code == hash_pass:
                print(f"{password} is the password.")
                break
            else:
                continue
    except:
        print("Error reading the file 'rockyou.txt'.")
except:
    print("Error reading the file 'hash'.")
